# Production Engineering - Week 1 - Portfolio Site

Welcome to the MLH Fellowship! During Week 1, you'll be using Flask to build a portfolio site. This site will be the foundation for activities we do in future weeks so spend time this week making it your own and reflect your personality!

## Tasks

Once you've got your portfolio downloaded and running using the instructions below, you should attempt to complete the following tasks.

For each of these tasks, you should create an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and work on them in a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches). When the task has been completed, you should open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and get another fellow in your pod to give you feedback before merging it in.

*Note: Make sure to include a link to the Issue you're progressing on inside of your Pull Request so your reviewer knows what you're progressing on!*

### GitHub Tasks
- [x] Create Issues for each task below
- [x] Progress on each task in a new branch
- [x] Open a Pull Request when a task is finished to get feedback

### Portfolio Tasks
- [x] Add a photo of yourself to the website
- [x] Add an "About youself" section to the website.
- [x] Add your previous work experiences
- [x] Add your hobbies (including images)
- [x] Add your current/previous education
- [x] Add a map of all the cool locations/countries you visited

### Flask Tasks
- [x] Get your Flask app running locally on your machine using the instructions below.
- [x] Add a template for adding multiple work experiences/education/hobbies using [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#basics)
- [x] Create a new page to display hobbies.
- [x] Add a menu bar that dynamically displays other pages in the app


## Getting Started

### Photo of yourself.

The placeholder photo and location which it is to be specified in have been changed for easier access. It has been moved to the content.json along with the rest of the program's input in an effort to make updating the website more painless.

### About yourself.
The user is able to specify the title and content of the "About Yourself" section in the content.json file.

### Work Experience.
The ability to seamlessly add work experience has been accomplished by using html and jinja and the content.json allowing those sections the user to painlessly add as any jobs as they like, there is a default value for the job's end date, setting it to "present".

### Hobbies
A seperate page listing the hobbies featuring images and descriptions has been added, the description has an empty string as a default value in case the user does not want to describe a given hobby. Like work experience, any amount of hobbies can be added to the site seamlessly without compromising its functionality. 

### Education
The education section allows users to specify their previous education in varying levels of detail. The end date variable has a default value of present for those still in education. In addition, the grade and skills sections are also optional.

### Travel Map
The travel map has been added to the home page, allowing the site owner to specify any number of visited countries using the content.json to specify the country name and location on the map.


## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy using the variables inside of the template)

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:
```
‚ùØ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser! 

*Note: The portfolio site will only work on your local machine while you have it running inside of your terminal. We'll go through how to host it in the cloud in the next few weeks!*
